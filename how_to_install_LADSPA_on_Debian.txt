LADSPA Noise Suppressor for Voice on Debian, for Kdenlive

as of 24 May 2023
Kent West - kent.west@(that .com that swore to not be evil)

    The "librnnoise_ladspa.so" shared library is not in Debian's "/usr/lib/ladspa" path, so there is no "LADSPA Noise Suppressor for Voice" plugin within Debian's Kdenlive. Arg. The plugin does not seem to be available in Debian, so we'll compile it from source.
    Go to github.com and search for "noise-suppressor-for-voice" (by werman). Click on the green "Code" pull-down menu, and select "Download zip". Download it to your "~/Downloads" folder.
    Go to your "~Downloads" folder, and "$ unzip "noise-suppressor-for-voice-master.zip" file (you may want to first move it into a "temp" directory, etc, to keep it separate from other files in your "~/Downloads" folder).
    cd into the newly-created "noise-suppressor-for-voice-master" directory.
    Run "cmake -Bbuild-x64 -H. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release".
        If "cmake" is not found, you may need to "$ sudo apt install cmake".
        If "Ninja" is not found, "$ sudo apt install ninja-build".
        If "PkgConfig" is not found, "$ sudo apt install pkg-config".
        If juceaide fails to build, look through the error messages for clues. It failed for me.
            When I looked through the generated messages, I found a line that said, "fatal error: ft2build.h: No such file or directory". I went to debian.org and searched the Packages for "ft2build.h", and found it in "libfreetype-dev", so I did a "$ sudo apt install libfreetype-dev".
            Re-running "cmake -Bbuild-x64 -H. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", juceaide still failed to build. This time the error was, "fatal error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory". So I searched Debian's packages, and then "$ sudo apt install libx11-dev".
            Re-running "cmake -Bbuild-x64 -H. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release", juceaide still failed to build. This time the error was, "fatal error: X11/extensions/Xrandr.h: No such file or directory". So I searched Debian's packages, and then "$ sudo apt install libxrandr-dev".
            Re-run "cmake -Bbuild-x64 -H. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release". This time, "fatal error: X11/extensions/Xinerama.h: No such file or directory", so "$ sudo apt install libxinerama-dev"
            Re-run cmake; this time: "Xcursor.h", so "$ sudo apt install libxcursor-dev".
            Re-run cmake; finally, success, with the message, "Build files have been written to: ~/Downloads/noise-suppressor-for-voice-master/build-x64".
    But we're not done yet; the library file we need is not yet in "build-x64/bin". So next, "$ ninja -C build-x64". Upon a successful run, there should now be a "librnnoise_ladspa.so" file in "build-x64/bin/ladspa".
    "$ sudo mv build-x64/bin/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so /usr/lib/ladspa/".
    "$ sudo chmod 644 /usr/lib/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so" (or match perms of other files here).
    "$ sudo chown root:root /usr/lib/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so" (or match perms of other files here).
    Restart Kdenlive if it's running; now you should be able to search Effects for "noise suppressor for voice".

UPDATE:

atsider at reddit/kdenlive writes that steps 6-9 can be replaced with:

"$ sudo ninja -C build_dir install"
Success!
